==============================================================================

CountCat performs a quick and dirty analysis of lines of SPARC Solaris
C-source code and tries to determine the effort required in porting to a Linux
based system.  During the analysis of the source code, ccat will flag any
areas that may be of concern during the porting of the code.

CountCat can run the source code on any supported Linux or Solaris system.  The
source code does not need to be on the system that will compile it, as long as
the source code is meant for SPARC Solaris, between version 7 and 11.

Supported OS:
=============

CountCat runs on either Solaris or Linux.

Requirements:
=============

CountCat requires ksh to be installed.

Installation:
=============

To install CountCat on an RPM based Linux distribution, as root, install the
rpm package.

To install CountCat on Solaris, or on any non-rpm based Linux distribution, as
root, untar the installation tarball.

Running the ccat Script:
========================

Once the installation is complete, run ccat in the root of the source tree.

On first run of the ccat script, it will ask you for the source system OS
level, and also the OS of the target system.

Example:

    # cd [source_code_dir]
    # /opt/ccat/bin/ccat [clean|reset|help]

During the execution of the script, ccat will provide a quick summary on the
console.  In addidtion, ccat will leave an html formatted report, ccat.html,
and a more indepth, detailed report called ccat_detail.html.

This report, in addition to the Migration Guide, will help to identify
occurances and level of difficulty of any possible issues on migrating code
from SPARC Solaris to x86 Linux.

The CountCat utility is to be used in conjuction with the Migration Guide.

ccat Command Line Options:
==========================

ccat has these command line options:

help
Help will display a description of the command line options.

quick
ccat just performs a quick file and line count of the c-source code and
header files.

clean
ccat will restore itself back to it's initial `install fresh` condition before
running.  This allows for selecting which release of Solaris the source code is
coming from, and to which release of Linux the code is being ported to.

reset
Reset is the same as clean, but does not launch the ccat script after cleaning.

Script Flow:
============

The initial phase of ccat inventories the source code tree and counts the number
of file and the total num ber of lines of both C-source and header files.

Next, the header files are compared and sorted as follows:

	1. Header files that are common between both Solaris and Linux

	2. Header files that are in Solaris only

	3. Header files that are included in the source code

Following this, pattern matching is performed looking for Solaris only system
calls, library calls, socket calls, POSIX and Solaris threads ands semiphores.
Also, binary calls, union declarations, terminal i/o error messages and other
such code is looked for.

Scripts are also searched, as they will have differences between the two
platforms.

Features/Bugs:
==============

Currently ccat does not distinguish comment lines from code.
